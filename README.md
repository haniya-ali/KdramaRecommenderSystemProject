# KdramaRecommenderSystemProject
By using a dataset that contains information about 1,646 Korean dramas, this project aims to provide the user with recommendations on which kdramas they can enjoy. The project utilizes an item-based collaborative filtering to generate recommendations based on the similarity between the ratings of the dramas.  
Note: The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle where the creator scraped a website to generate the final dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noorrizki/top-korean-drama-list-1500. 

The potential applications of this project are as follows:
1. A user can determine if they have the right subscriptions to access their next kdrama
2. A user can identify their favorite genres
