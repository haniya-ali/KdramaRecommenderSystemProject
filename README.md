# KdramaRecommenderSystemProject
By using a dataset that contains information about 1,646 Korean dramas, this project aims to provide the user with recommendations on which kdramas they can enjoy. The project utilized an item-based collaborative filtering to generate recommendations based on the similarity between the ratings of the dramas.  The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle where the creator scraped a website to generate the final dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noorrizki/top-korean-drama-list-1500.
